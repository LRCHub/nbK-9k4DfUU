```
minimal love minimal love minimal love
oh!

Don't hide, don't you go there
Don't even try to tell me i'm very sick of you
And there's no places we can go for better

Even if you think we're fine
I can feel the lack of honesty, baby
Even if you kissed me sweet
I can take it any longer

It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore

Ok, yes i got you this is your way to love me
But now i know it's not the way i wanted to be in a courtship

Even if you think we're fine
I can feel the lack of honesty, baby
Even if you kissed me sweet
I can take it any longer

It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore
It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore

minimal love

oh ...oh oh oh

It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore

minimal love

Don't hide, don't you go there
Don't even try to tell me i'm very sick of you
And there's no places we can go for better

Even if you think we're fine
I can feel the lack of honesty, baby
Even if you kissed me sweet
I can take it any longer

It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore
It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore
oh!
It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore
